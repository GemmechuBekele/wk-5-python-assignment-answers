# 🧠 OOP Assignment - Object-Oriented Programming in Python

## 📌 Description

This repository contains solutions for an introductory Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment in Python. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of **classes**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**.

## 🏗️ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class!

Create a Python class representing **anything you like** — such as a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero! Your class should:

- Include meaningful **attributes** and **methods**
- Use a **constructor (`__init__`)** to initialize objects with unique values
- Include at least **one layer of inheritance**
- Explore **encapsulation** (using private/protected variables or getter/setter methods)

### ✅ Example Concepts Used:
- Class and Object creation
- Inheritance (`SuperClass` → `SubClass`)
- Encapsulation with private variables (`__attribute`)
- Method definition and object interaction

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

In this activity, you’ll create **multiple classes** (such as `Bird`, `Lion`, `Fish`, etc.) that all implement a method named `move()` — but each class defines the behavior of `move()` differently.

### 🔧 Sample Behavior:
```python
bird.move()    # Output: Flying
lion.move()  # Output: Walking
fish.move()   # Output: Swimming
